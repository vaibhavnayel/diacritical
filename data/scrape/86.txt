### Yuvadhara Calling!

> If YOU belong to a Chitrapur Saraswat family and are between 18 and 35, it is time you stepped out of your world of confusing choices, too little exercise and unlimited stress. It is time you joined a large group of joyful youngsters whose confidence, all-round development and pride about their sacred roots is being lovingly nurtured by our beloved Mathadhipati Parama Pujya Sadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji. Here is a kaleidoscopic ‘round-up’ **by ADITYA CHANDAVARKAR, Chief Coordinator, Chitrapur Yuvadhara** of a few of the many ways in which Yuvas 'grew' together over the last one year                                  Photo credit: SCM Anushravas                       ( August 2018)

The _Chitrapur Yuvadhara Sammelanam_ is organised every year during Parama Pujya Swamiji’s _Chaturmas Vrata,_ to give Yuvas a golden opportunity to offer _seva_ during this auspicious time.

The Gokulashtami celebrations were organised as a part of the _Sammelanam_ which was held from 12 – 15 August, 2017. Here is what a Yuva had to say about her experience:

“The rains stopped just in time as if encouraging us to give of our best! With Pujya Swamiji smilingly looking on, red _gulaal_ in the air, excitement in our hearts and battle cries of “Govinda Re Govinda” the Yuvas and Yuvatis made human pyramids and successfully broke all the four _handis_. All of us truly felt as if we had been transported to Brindavan as we clapped and sang along, while Pujya Swamiji led us in a _bhajan_. We felt like gopis and gopikas in the presence of our Lord Krishna! We then received the traditional Janmashtami _Prasad_  from Pujya Swamiji.”

Around 30 Yuvas from Mumbai, Pune, Chennai and Bangalore _sabhas_ participated actively in the planning and execution of all the activities during _Seemolanghan_ and provided an able support system for the staff at Karla Math to ensure both discipline and clockwork precision. The visual alongside shows them managing the overflowing sea of devotees during the glorious _ShobhaYatra_ commemorating the successful completion of Pujya Swamiji’s _Chaturmasya Vrata._

Yuvas got an opportunity to interact with Shri Shankar Mahadevan during his visit to Karla on 26th December, 2017. Shankar Mahadevanji shared his experience and was happy to answer all the questions the Yuvas had for him. The Yuvas also surprised Shankar Mahadevan with a beautiful medley of his famous songs at the end of the session and this melodious conclusion of a stimulating afternoon was greatly appreciated by him.

With the Blessings of Parama Pujya Swamiji, Chitrapur Yuvadhara organised Yuvathon 2018 - **A walk by youngsters to commemorate the historic _Guru Jyoti Pada Yatra_** for the sixth successive year on Sunday, 18th February, 2018, under the leadership of Krishnanand Heblekarmaam. There were 48 participants who covered a distance of 11 kms over 5.5 hrs. Post the Yuvathon, Yuvas got an opportunity to interact with Parama Pujya Swamiji. This made them forget all their tiredness and everyone felt joyful and refreshed as they headed back to their busy lives!

Yuvas hailing from all over India travel to the serene town of Shirâli for _Karaseva_ every summer. _Karaseva_ is organized by a group of _Sanchalaks_ and the activities planned lead to the physical, mental and spiritual development of the Yuvas. Helping to dredge ponds, carrying bales of hay, learning to chant _stotras_ or even weave garlands for the deities are all different forms of _seva,_ which seamlessly strengthen the bond between the Yuvas and their beloved Swamiji who is like a beacon gently helping the perplexed Gen.next to return ‘home’. The invaluable experience also revs up their love, reverence and pride about their Shri Chitrapur Math and the hallowed _Guruparampara_ they have been blessed with. Every year, apart from the regular ones  yet another fresh set of Yuvas attend this wonderful _Shivir_ and carry  back cherished memories and  priceless lessons.
