**SADHANA SHIBIR - GOA**

**27TH – 29TH APRIL 2009**

By - Smt.Sabita Harite

Sadhana Shibir, to mark Shankar Jayanti Mahotsava this year, was held in Mangeshi, Goa. Sadhakas numbering 125 from 21 Sabhas, including UAE & USA, participated in the Shibir to make it a fulfilling spiritual experience for all. The Shibir commenced on the auspicious day of Akshaya Tritiya on April 27th with Abhisheka of Lord Mangesh in Mangeshi Temple being performed by our Parama Poojya Swamiji at 6.30 a.m. as the Shibirarthis continuously sang Shiva Bhajans and chanted Stotras in unison, which must have definitely made Lord Bhavanishankar very happy as mentioned by Parama Pujya Swamiji in his Aashirvachan. The morning session of the Shibir began with Swadhyaya on selected Shlokas of ‘Viveka Chudamani’ as Swamiji guided the Shibirarthis to glide into the spiritual realm and experience the sweetness of Sadhana. In the evening, Shri Krishnanand Mankikarmaam lucidly spoke on the life & works of Adi Shankaracharya. This was followed by Paramarsha with Parama Pujya Swamiji.

The second day of the Shibir also began with Swadhyaya in continuation of the previous day and the evening sessions comprised of continuation of talk by Shri Krishnanand Mankikarmaam followed by screening of Swamiji’s Ashirvachan at Karla on March 6th.

Shankar Jayanti day dawned with intense feelings of devotion and dedication towards our Math and Guru Parampara as the Shibirarthis chanted Shree Bhavanishankar Suprabhatam. To commemorate the occasion of Birth Anniversary of Adi Shankaracharya, Bhashya Parayan was conducted by Shri Krishnanand Mankikarmaam & Smt. Udaya Mavinkurvepacchi. P.P.Swamiji performed the Maha Aarti & Danda Poojan at noon. The much-awaited evening session began with a Tableau named ‘Shaankarastotramala’ presented by Yuvas and Shibirarthis jointly. The concept and script was by Smt Jyothi Divgi of Pune consisting of various Shlokas penned by Adi Shankaracharya. The narration relating to the Shlokas was lucidly presented by Yuvatis, Shambhavi Padukone and Shivani Kalyanpur. It was accompanied by projection of CD which served as a backdrop, the CD being excellently worked upon by Panemanglore Pritipacchi. Yuva, Chinmay Ubhayakar projected the CD. Shlokas were devotionally chanted by Udaya Mavinkurvepacchi & Vinati Udyavarpacchi, accompanied by Pacchis, Shobha Puthli, Suman Samsi & Manju Jamalabad. The Ganga Stotra was aptly choreographed by Alka Lajmipacchi. The characters were played by Kumar Aditya Kapnadak as young Shankaracharya, Yuva,Sushant Harite as older Shankaracharya, Kumar Mangesh Shirali & Aditya Kapnadak as Shishyas, Uma Savurpacchi as old woman of Kanakadharastotram, Kumari Aishwarya Nazare as Devi Lakshmi (she also beautifully danced to Ganga Stotra), Ravi Chandavarkarmaam as Chandala & Shiva in Manisha Panchakam, Kavita Karnad as Parvati & Nandkumar Heblemaam as old Pandit in Bhaja Govindam. The English script was translated into Konkani by Smt. Smita Mavinkurve and the direction was by Smt. Uma Trasi, which received a loud applause. Shri Girish Honavar mimicked barking of dogs (accompanying Chandala in Manisha Panchakam).

As Parama Pujya Swamiji clapped in appreciation of the Tableau, it seemed as though our Parama Guru also showered his Anugraha on the participants as during recitation of ‘Upadesha Panchakam’, the concluding Stotras of the Tableau, the ‘Danda’ held by Adi Shankaracharya played by Sushant Harite remained hooked to the backdrop on the stage which had the picture of our Parama Guru. During rehearsals, the Danda would otherwise always slip down his shoulders when he had to sit with ‘Chin Mudra’.

After the Tableau, Parama Pujya Swamiji enlightened the Sadhakas with Aashirvachan elucidating the need and means of self-realisation. Later, He performed the evening pooja of Adi Shankaracharya.

The noon pooja and evening pooja on all three days had active participation by all Shibirarthis and the gaps in between the sessions were filled in with Lalita Sahasranaam by Latika Heblepacchi and Devi Anushthan & Navaratri Nityapaath by Sujata Haldipurpacchi.

Thus, the Sadhana Shibir held at the ‘Kulaar’ of Aamchis was participated in the true sense of completeness by all Sabhas as one single family bringing about ‘Dridhata’ to their individual Sadhana.
