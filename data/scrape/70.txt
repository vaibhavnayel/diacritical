### Prasadika (Divine Blessings)

> **A Report by Suman Mañjeshwar, Puṇe**

Āmmī Sāraswat Bhāgyavanta…

Truly, we Chitrāpur Sāraswats are blessed to be born in a community which has had such a glorious lineage of divine Guru-s for over three centuries. So each one of us was waiting eagerly to be part of the Shas͟hṭyabdapūrti Utsava – to commemorate the 60th Janmadivasa of our revered 11th Mat͟hādhipati of Shrī Chitrāpur Mat͟h - H.H. Shrīmat Sadyojāt Shaṅkarāshram Swāmījī.  Every section of our samāja – children, Yuvā-s, Gīrvāṇapratis͟ht͟hā teachers, members of the laity from all over the world, and also our Sāraswat bāndhava-s from Rājasthān lovingly put together cultural programmes to offer as sevā to a Guru who has been doing so much for every section of our samāja over the last 27 years.  The Utsava began on the 9th of November 2024 and culminated on 17th of November 2024.  During the Utsava, various products and services were offered at the counters put up by Saṁvit Sudhā, Publications, Prāsādika Sārī-s, Sevā department as well as the Pādukā pūjana section.

As a volunteer, I felt blessed when I was asked to head our Devī Durgā Parameshwarī’s Prāsādika-sārī counter. What could be more fortunate than handling the 254 sārī-s and helping sādhaka-s and sādhikā-s to take home one or more of these sacred Blessings?

These Prāsādika-sārī-s are routinely available for purchase by devotees at the Mandir but it proved to be a good idea to put up this stall inside the Kailāsa Sabhā Maṇḍapam along with the other stalls for better visibility.  There were different types of sārī-s – both six and nine yards in length…like cotton, silk, georgette, Pait͟haṇī, Kāñjeevaram, Benāras and even some synthetic ones too. The price range was from Rs.350 to Rs. 19,000, with one exclusive piece priced at Rs.39,100!

Almost every sādhikā who entered the Kailāsa Sabhā Maṇḍapam visited the stall and some even came by everyday.  It was wonderful to see the blissful expression on the face of every buyer. The thoughtfully created bright lighting added allure to the sārī-s….it really felt as if the Devī had chosen who will take away one or more of these prized possessions!

Five of us volunteered at the sārī counter and we were supported greatly by the volunteers at the sevā booking, Saṁvit Sudhā and Publications counters because they encouraged people to visit our stall.  By the last day of the Utsava not a single sārī remained in our two cupboards.  The sale was a total success!

The team felt so grateful that we could offer this sevā at the Holy Feet of  H.H. Swāmījī, our sacred Guruparamparā, Devī Durgā Parameshwarī and Lord Bhavānīshaṅkar.
