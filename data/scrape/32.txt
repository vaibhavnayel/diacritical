### Girvanapratishtha Sanchalitam Sanskrit- Sambhashan Shibiram 2019

> If you do not know Sanskrit and yet discover joyfully that you can  understand many words in the text below, it is because Sanskrit is the treasure-house of all the root-words from which many regional languages have arrived at their individual vocabulary. A day-long Shivir was held recently in Mumbai to enable students to sharpen their conversational skills in Sanskrit. Presenting Sheetal Chandaver's report on the stimulating event in flawless DEVABHASHA            (August 2019)

**Have you ever sat in a classroom where talking is a ‘must’? If your answer is ‘No!” then you have not attended a lively Sanskrit - _Sambhashan_ class as yet. Shri Chitrapur Math’s _Girvanapratishta_ is a vibrant movement initiated by our Beloved Mathadhipati - Parama Pujya Sadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji to encourage _sadhaka-_ s to learn this _Devabhasha_ and then, speak in  it as well. Sujata Masurkarpachi gives a detailed report on an extremely interesting day-long _shivir_ held in Mumbai recently by some of the  dedicated Sanskrit teachers of _Girvanapratishtha_**

Every year _Girvanapratishtha_ conducts a _Sanskrit Sambhashan Shivir_ in Shri Anandashram, Khar Math. This year it was held on May 1st, which is a holiday and therefore, there was an overwhelming response from all new and old students of Sanskrit. Whatsapp is also a boon today  to reach  out to many  people and inform them about any programme.

On Wednesday, 1st May everyone assembled at Khar Math before 9.30am and completed the formal registration. We were allotted a batch with our name and a name of the group we belong to. There were 4 groups named after the holy rivers, Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari and Saraswati with 4 different colour-tags. The volunteers at the registration desk were Kavita Karnadpachi and Smita Nagarkattipachi. After that formality was completed, all of us enjoyed a delicious breakfast of _idli-chutney_, pineapple _shira_ and tea/coffee.

Exactly at 10 am, as per the schedule, the _shivir_ started with the _Sabha Prarambh Prarthana_ and _Girvana Geetam_ sung by Vaishali Koppikar pachi and Kanchan Honnavar pachi.

Then the main organiser, our erstwhile chief-coordinator Sujata Haldipurpachi welcomed all lovingly and told us how all the Swamijis of our _Parampara_ loved  Sanskrit and had mastery over it and also how our present Mathadhipati Parama Pujya Sadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji is keen that all of us should learn Sanskrit.

Vaishali Koppikarpachi did the _sutra-sanchalan_ for the entire programme. She asked all _shivirarthi-_ s to, turn by turn, introduce ourselves in Sanskrit.

After this Padmini Balsekarpachi organised an interesting game called ‘ _Upanaam-Gram-naam_ _kreeda’._ She read out each description in short in Sanskrit and we had to find the State, City, Place in Maharashtra or in the suburbs of Mumbai, (one round of each). For example _Vishaal Desh_ referred to Maharashtra, _Vahanam Aanayatu_ was  Karla (Car _La_, did you get that?), _Santosh Nagaram_ was Ulhas Nagar etc. The 4 groups had been created earlier with such games in mind. We really enjoyed this game very much!

At 10.45 am Ravindra Shiralimam explained in lucid Sanskrit and English, the meaning of select _shloka_-s from _Ganga Lahari_ by Mahakavi Jagannath, and he also told us about how he was devoted to Ganga and considered Ganga as most sacred and above all the Gods and how, finally, She absorbed Kavi Jagannath in her _pravaaha_ at the end of the 52nd verse.

News-time was at 11.45am. Sheetalpachi Chandavar gave the fortnightly news in Sanskrit in a clear voice. The programme was called _‘Vaartanshaha’_. She made it so interesting by showing slide shows on the projector and creating an atmosphere of T.V. news by inserting sound bytes between every two segments of news. In spite of having a lot of technical difficulties, she managed to do it successfully and everyone simply loved it.

After the news in Sanskrit, Sujata Haldipurpachi  sang our favourit _‘Pathata Sanskritam’_ and all of us sang after her. Another interesting game called  ‘ _Koham_?’ was then conducted by Shrikala Kowshikpachi. (This was to be conducted by Sona Chandavarkarpachi but she could not attend due to some unavoidable reason). The game moved in this fashion-in a small box there were chits with names  like Rama, Krishna and Arjun and so on, written on them. Like passing the parcel, that box was passed on to the next person to the sound of a _manjiri_ .  When Durgapachi Kumta would stop the _manjiri_-sound, then whoever was holding the box,  would pick up a chit and explain in Sanskrit the description/ attributes of  the person mentioned in the chit, without disclosing the name, so that the answer could be guessed by the audience. All were eager to answer and we had a lot of fun!!

Then it was the time for a sumptuous lunch of _amras- puri_, fruit _sasam_ and other delicious curries ending with a very  nice _mukhavaas._

After this tasty meal, all of us may have dozed off,  if the next programme  was a lecture. But the organizers had wisely planned to conduct another lively game named ‘ _Kandol kreeda’_. This  was held in the open for the next half- hour and conducted by Varada Savkur pachi who was assisted by Vidya Yennemadi pachi, Durga Kumtapachi, Padmini Balsekarpachi  and Sangeeta Pawarpachi. In this game they had kept various items in four baskets for the four groups. The names of the items were explained in Sanskrit by Varadapachi. Each group had approximately 20 members. Each member of a group was given a number . When a particular number was called out, the person having that number from each group had to come and stand in a row and then run to fetch from their group’s basket the item that was called out. Since the competition was all about who will reach the destination first to get marks, all of us enjoyed running back with _swadu moolam_ (carrot), _jambeer_ (lemon), _palandu_ (onion), _kandook_ (ball) and so on and on! We were all laughing and clapping non-stop. So _Nidradevi_ left us and we were fresh to listen to the next session on a topic that  is dear to all - a talk on  _Rathotsava_ by Krishnanand Mankikarmam.

Krishnanand mam explained all aspects of _Rathotsava_, its history, importance, spiritual meaning, why it was stopped and how it was started again in 1973 with _Gurubhakti_ by Parama Pujya Parijnanashram Swamiji (III). All of this was narrated first in Sanskrit and then in English with a few pictures. He also explained the _shloka_ written on the _Ratha_.

After this illuminating talk, it was game-time again! This time the _kreeda_ was ‘ _Geetani/Vignyapanani’_ by Durga Kumtapachi. This was to recognise the song explained in Sanskrit and then to sing that song with Sanskrit lyrics; so also with the commercial advertisements. All of us enjoyed this thoroughly!’

At 3.30 in ‘ _Katha kathan’_,  Sangeeta Pawarpachi told an interesting story of an elephant and a pig in simple words, asked us questions  about the story and its moral. By then, we had all turned into eager schoolchildren lifting our hand and wanting to answer a question before the rest of the class did! In fact, this happened during every game that day.

Now the _Shivir_ was coming to an end! All _Subhashitani_ in Sanskrit contain some message, or a pun, or some humour. Vaishalipachi selected three beautiful _Subhashitas_ and explained their meaning nicely and made the session really interesting.

Last, but certainly not the least, was a patriotic song ‘ _Priyam Bharatam’_ sung by Kanchan Mannige, Shailaja Gangolli and Sujata Masurkar pachis which was repeated by all with the help of the copies distributed to everyone in advance.

Finally, the success of the day’s _Shivir_ was offered at the Lotus Feet of our Guruvarya with reverence and the _Shivir_ came to an end with everybody chanting the _Sabha Samapti Prarthana_. Of course all of us had a heartwarming cup of  tea/coffee with biscuits, and wafers to nibble, before leaving.

Nobody knew how time had really flown past. All the _Sanchalikas_ had taken a lot of trouble to teach Sanskrit through a variety of programmes like fun-filled games, interesting lectures, informative news reading, beautiful songs, making the entire _Shivir rasamaya_. Now we are all waiting for the next _Shivir_!!
