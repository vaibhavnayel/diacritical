**Hero Motor Corp Factory visit**

Delhi Sabha had organized a visit to the Hero Motor Corp Factory on the 25th Feb 2017.A number of young people including the Prarthana varga, young Sabha members and yuvas participated in the outing. There were a total of 35 members including Yuvas Akshay and Pallavi, Rao, Ashutosh Gokarn, Chaitanya Betrebet, Tanvi Betrebet , Nupur Sharma and Ishani Rajpal.

**Report on the Hero Motor Corp Factory visit by Ullal Akshay Rao:**

Cars and bikes have always been a passion for me since the time I was a little kid. I fondly remember playing with my elder brother, Prashant's "dinky" cars while escaping from my homework. A few days ago I had the chance to be up close and personal with some gleaming machines all due to the kind courtesy of Mahesh Kaikini maam.

It was early February when the Delhi yuvas got an interesting proposal to consider. It was a visit to the Hero Motocorp factory at Neemrana on a Saturday, organized by the Delhi Sabha. What got me most interested was that this was supposed to be India's first "green" factory so much so that Hero had called it a "Garden Factory" This intrigued me as I was fascinated to understand how machinery & nature could co-exist. With all these questions in my head, I reached the factory at around 9:30AM with my wife and some other youth members of the Delhi sabha. It was a lovely 1 hour drive on a cool morning.

We were ushered in by courteous personnel at the gates. What struck me was their humility and desire to make us comfortable. After a sumptuous breakfast, we were given a short AV on the safety procedures to observe in the plant as well as a brief profile of the Hero company. With this our tour had begun! We were handed walkie talkies and divided into 2 groups. Our group supervisor patiently took us around the entire shopfloor (we were walking on an aerial bridge) while workers worked below. We were amazed to know that a Hero bike is produced every 8-10 seconds! After this we were taken to see the green house where the company grows cucumber, lettuce and tomatoes. The temperature in the green houses is carefully controlled. Infact, the whole temperature of the factory is regulated such that it is always cool and comfortable. There are green walls abound in the factory so that workers always feel close to nature.

After a tasty lunch (with veggies plucked from the garden), we were shown Hero Motocorp's state of the art Global Parts Center with it's high tech cranes & complex inventory management system. It was truly a leaning on processes in the manufacturing industry.

With this the tour was over, but not before some lovely evening tea and snacks and Mahesh mam and Uma pachi's house!

**(5) DADAR**

**22nd January 2017 – Ninada Session**

Many situations occur, when we are well prepared, but when the opportune moment arises, we get so wound up in all the excitement and nervousness that we end up suffering from a lack of confidence. In such times, we try to achieve composure and try to gather ourselves by hook or by crook but in the haste to keep calm. We only worsen the situation. This is where Ninada is useful in helping achieve some semblance of that composure. So, on 22nd January 10 of our yuvas (Radhika Tonsey, Prathamesh Kini, Mitali Puthli, Medha Karkal, Sanika Balwally,Ankita Chandavarkar, Sohil Koppikar, Nikhil Kadle, Vaishnavi Honnavar and Divya Vinekar) took the opportunity to learn this useful breathing technique. The session was conducted by Mohit Karkal. Following this they got to know about Ninada in more detail when they saw a video of Swamiji's Ninada session held during Guru Ranjani at Santacruz.

**24th February 2017 – Mahashivaratri**

As is the norm, on the evening of 24th February, 25 of our Sadhakas, yuvas included, headed to Karla to take part in the Chaar Yaam Mahashivratri Pujan. 2 yuvas, Mohit Karkal, Aditya Chandavarkar and Niyati Puthli were among the 8 sadhakas who performed the Chaar Yaam Mahashivratri Pujan. Also, Nikhil Kadle, Ankita Chandavarkar and Medha Karkal joined in the chanting and also helped the devotees performing the Pujan.

**7th March 2017 – Participation in Grama Bhojan**

Sanika Balwally and Mitali **Puthli participated in the Grama Bhojan held at Karla on 7th March.**
