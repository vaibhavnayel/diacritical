Vocalist

![](https://chitrapurmath.net/documents/upload/1635525795Cover_1._Pt._Indudhar_Nirody.jpg)Pt. Indudhar Niroḍy was born on 11th July 1935 in Puttūr (Daks͟͟hinā Kannaḍa District – Karnāṭaka State). He comes from a family which had the musical lineage. His grand-father was a practising Sitār player and his father had learnt Vocal Music from Pt. Nīlakāntbuā Shāstrī at Hospeṭ.

Pt.Niroḍy was initiated into music at the young age of 10 by his father Niroḍy Sunderrāo and had the opportunity of learning at Uḍupī (Karnāṭaka) from Gawaī Pitre Rāmarāo, a disciple of Pt. Vināyakrāo Paṭwardhan. He had the unique distinction of giving his first concert in Hindustanī Music at his age of 12 at Kundāpur (Karnāṭaka) which was appreciated by all who had heard him.  On migrating to Mumbaī in 1951, he was further trained by Pt. Gurudatt HebĪekar.  At the same time, he came under the tutelage of Stalwarts in Hindustanī Classical Music – Āchārya SCR Bhaṭ, Āchārya KG Ginde, Pt. Dinkar Kaikiṇī and Pt. Chidānand Nagarkar.  He received intensive training under them for well over two decades.

It has been his good fortune that being amongst the senior-most disciples of his mentors, apart from receiving systematic training from them, he has also had the opportunity of giving vocal accompaniment to them during concerts, thereby maintaining a close association with them over the years. This has helped him to assimilate and imbibe some of the finest aspects of Rāgadarī Sāṅgīta in his own music. He is a stickler for tradition However, he improvises his music with great imagination giving importance to the aesthetic contents of the Bandish-s. While his forte is Khayāl singing, having received training in Āgrā Gharānā style, he is equally comfortable in rendering Dhrupad-Dhamar-s and T͟humrī-s. He has performed at various centres in the Country and received laudable appreciation from the connoisseurs. He has also given Lecture-Demonstrations on various aspects of Hindustanī Classical Music at several Institutions in Karnāṭaka. He is also a visiting Professor with Karnāṭaka University, Dhārwāḍ and Dr. Gaṅgubaī Haṅgal Music & Performing Arts University, Mysūru.
