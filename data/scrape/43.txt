The following is a brief outline of the discussions by participants.

**Truth**: Why people lie? - They may be embarrassed, may do so to protect someone from the truth for their own good, to improve or better themselves, or to make themselves feel better. However, why one should not lie - honesty makes one feel better about oneself by telling the truth, gives one a clear conscience, and reassures that others will not be able to find out that you have lied, you don’t have to remember what you have said to cover the truth.

The question was asked how do we know what is the truth? - A variety of answers such as - from facts, by trusting other people who you think would tell the truth. Truth was also considered to depend on perception. It was thought that being gullible would be detrimental to you, your family and friends because of the inability for you to judge what is truth.

**Charity**: It was voiced that by helping others, one would feel better, also by spreading happiness, money, time and serving someone who is not well, or even teaching someone. However, the group felt that daan (charity) should not be given indiscriminately. It should not be given to everyone but be given to someone who is willing to use it to improve and pass it on.

**Industriousness**: Laziness can occur when someone procrastinates, has nothing else to do, or is afraid of failure. It is important to establish a routine or habit and to prioritise tasks.

**Jealousy**: Can be caused by insecurity, negativity, or an inferiority complex. Envy is bad if it is hurtful but can be used positively if you can aspire and improve yourself.

**Forgiveness**: One needs to forgive but there have to be boundaries so that others don't hurt you. Need to learn from what people do but not to bear a grudge.

**Fortitude**: Integrity- to be firm when you are right, but stubbornness is when you may know you are wrong but still continue to argue your point. Being stubborn was considered to eventually hurt you when you come to realise the futility of being stubborn when you are wrong.

Finally, **fortitude** may be helped by having faith in your Guru, and this faith and belief will help you overcome hurdles in life.

The vimarsh was conducted for a total of 45 minutes. Almost 85% of the audience including youth and 2 children 8-12 years of age contributed to the vimarsh. Many had attended a vimarsh for the first time. Overall feedback received was very positive. One of the comments received from the yuvas - vimarsh was intellectually stimulating and interesting. The relatively large number of participants, with this being a first-time experience for many may have led to some feeling shy to voice their opinions. Some yuvas said that they were thinking about the discussion points from vimarsh on their way home which suggests that this vimarsh was well received.
