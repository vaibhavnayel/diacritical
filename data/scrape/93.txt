### Flame

> **By Anurādhā NaimpaĪĪy**

During H.H. Shrīmat Parijñānāshram Swāmījī’s visit to Canada in 1979, He and His entourage spent ten days with us in our home Thunder Bay.  For each of those days, the house was filled with music, chanting, and a beautiful atmosphere as the As͟hṭāvadhana pūjā was performed elaborately every evening. I spent as much time as possible with the members of the group and learned a lot about āyurvedic practices they would do in their daily routines, why and how various parts of the pūjā are performed, and Swāmījī also spoke on various topics. I remember mornings where I would see Swāmījī’s assistant do his daily routines of washing eyes with cold water, doing neti, and then yogāsana-s. He patiently explained how these practices helped clear the mind and keep the eyes bright.

Every evening was eventful with the elaborate As͟hṭāvadhana pūjā.  Our home had a basement with a large hall that ended into a pūjā room.  Āmmā and Ānnu had framed pictures of all deities along with some idols filling one entire wall. This is where we gathered for Sunday bhajana-s. During these ten days, Bhaṭ mām set up a beautiful altar of Lord Bhavānīshaṅkar and performed the pūjā with flair.  He would wave the ārati gracefully, offering different recordings of instruments, verses from scriptures, and stories as a part of the daily obeisance.  He readily explained all this to us as we watched with amazement.

I remember Swāmījī having a very keen sense of humor. One day at the dinner table, Nālkur Srīpād mām, who was the founder and president of a highly successful company called Pest Control India, Pvt Ltd. was talking about different professions. In this particular discussion he was questioning why a particular person had taken up their chosen path. To this, Swāmījī responded with a twinkle in his eye “Vhai re, tu tari mūs mārnu kās kartā!” (You make a living swatting flies!) Everyone, including Srīpād mām, let out a hearty laugh at this light-hearted observation by Swāmījī.

**FLAME**

written during H.H. Shrīmat Parijñānāshram Swāmījī’s visit to Canada

This world overwhelms me.

It seems to swallow me in its grievances.

But you came and showed me

Only so much reality they possess.

No more can they eat up my energy

For you have consumed me in your compassion

Burning my ignorance in your flame of knowledge

Leaving nothing as ash

Only a single steady flame within which we abide as one.

**Kirtan Karlo**

A Bhajana written by my mother Smt Sudhā NaimpaĪĪy

Guru Mandir me aawo aawo

Kirtan karlo swami ke, sab \|\|

Tanu kaashaambar danda hasta dhara

Tumhi sabke praana sakhaa

Charanakamala par seetya namaavu \|\|1\|\|

Anandashram Satguru vandana

Parijnanshram Shri guru namana

Pranam Sadjyojat Shankar satguru \|\|2\|\|
