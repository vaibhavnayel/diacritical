**BORIVALI**

**27 May 2017**

A Vimarsha session was organised by Borivali Yuvadhara at CSA room, Vamanashram on 27th May 2017 at 5 pm. It was conducted by Smt.Shilpa Mudur Pacchi which was attended by Arya Dhareshwar, Ananya Dhareshwar, Akash Aldangdy, Ritwik Murdeshwar, Omkar Yederi, Srikala Nalkoor and Deepa Katre Pacchi (Cordinator). The session was an inspiring delight and an eye opener towards adhyatmic life.

The following shloka was taken for the session,

**_Shri Mangalat prabhavati, pragalbhyat sampravardhate_**

**_Dakshyat tu kurute mulam, Sanyamat pratitistati_**

The session started with Sabha praramba prarthana. The shloka was introduced, first with its pronunciation and later the meaning of each word was explained. “Shree” could be our material possessions or our strengths or something that we seek. It could be seen as a goal or a desire, idea or thought to do good. It starts with positive intentions, a sankalpa, and moves forward with positive deeds going towards that goal. Beginning with examples from our daily lives, Shilpa pacchi moved to the spirit within us. We were thus enlightened towards the adhyatmic sense. Desire, determination and dedication would lead us to the realization of our goals.

Following is the summary of the session:

- To achieve or to attain a qualification, one must first make a firm resolution to complete the task come what may. Later, one has to put in efforts to enrich and become better day by day tackling the obstacles that come in our way. We must put the sankalpa into practice – this was pragalbya.

- There are bound to be obstacles which hinder pragalbya. We have to ensure that pragalbya does not desert us by keeping good company or satsang. We must become daksha by understanding the tendency of the mind and disciplining it with the help of japa and get atmabala. This will make us efficient. We have to take care that our dakshata does not make us egoistic, otherwise the mangalata of the sankalpa will be lost. We need sayyam or restraint to help us be focussed on the shree.

- In the adhyatmic sense, Shree is everlasting happiness and to achieve that, one has make a sankalpa which is achieved by doing japa regularly without fail, putting aside the daily tantrums and reasoning. Constant anusmaran of the Shree will guide us. Also one must not leave aside the regular chores to keep doing japa for hours long. One can achieve this stage slowly and gradually doing it with dedication and devotion. Then, though we do it with a short span in the start, it becomes effortless later on as you develop a liking for it.


Later on the session was concluded with sabha samapti prarthana after yuvas summarized the points discussed the summary of the session.

1. Sabha commencement prayers followed by the Parijyanashrama Triodashi were led exclusively by 8 members of the Delhi Yuvadhara .
2. At the meeting of the 16th April, it had been decided that for the Shankara Jayanti celebrations this year the yuvas would do some research on the philosophy of Adi Shankara and write out one page of what they had understood and read it out to the audience. It had been made clear that the paper was to be on the Advaita philosophy of Shri Adi Shanakara and not on His life events. The Yuvas had bravely accepted the assignment and had done their homework and each one of them read out a paper( one or 2 pages) on Shri Adi Shankara’s philosophy.. Many of them were coming across certain words and concepts for the first time, but did a creditable job which was highly appreciated by the seniors. . Every reading/presentation was followed by a small open discussion with all Sabha members with the seniors adding to it. In the words of one of the participating yuvatis “The presentations helped initiate the Yuvas into reading and thinking about the philosophy in a broad sense”. It was a difficult assignment and kudos to the yuvas who accepted it and rose to the occasion! It was quite an impressive performance! All the yuvas present namely Akshay and Pallavi Rao, Shambhavi Padukone Rana, Ananya Majumdar, Ishani Rajpal, Divya Kumta, Chaitanya and Tanvi Betrebet read out a paper.
