#### [Profile](https://chitrapurmath.net/gauravam?id=1\#collapseOne_1)

![](https://chitrapurmath.net/documents/upload/1633349001Cover_1._Lalith_Rao_portrait.jpg)Vidus͟hī Lalith J. Rāo is the acknowledged doyenne of the Āgrā-Atraulī Gharānā, having trained under stalwarts like Padma Bhūs͟haṇ Ustād Khādim Hussain Khān, Paṇḍit Rāmarāo Nāik, and Paṇḍit Dinkar Kaikiṇī. Her mastery and contributions to Indian Classical Music have been recognised and awarded at the State and National levels. She has performed over a thousand concerts across the world and made a mark at almost every major music festival and music circle of the country.

Apart from enriching Indian Classical Music with her unique productions and performances, she has contributed to the field in myriad and diverse ways. She has headed and implemented a Ford Foundation archival project for the Saṅgīta Research Academy of Kolkatā. She herself rendered a few hundred Āgrā Gharānā Rāga-s and compositions for the archives of the Ethno-Musicolgy Dept of Washington University, the National Centre for the Performing Arts (NCPA) Mumbai and an Ahmedābād-based music foundation. Propagating the cause of Hindustānī Classical music and tradition has always been close to her heart, and towards which she has conducted scores of lecture-demonstrations at renowned Universities and Music Schools. A long-time “Top-grade” artiste of All India Radio and Doordarshan, she’s currently grooming talented musicians in BeṅgaĪūru and abroad in the authentic Āgrā-Atrauli Gharānā tradition. It is a tribute to her dedication and effort that BeṅgaĪūru is today recognised as an important hub of the Gharānā.

At the instance of Parama Pūjya Sadyojāt Shaṅkarāshram Swāmījī, a multi-media musical performance “Guru Vātsalyam Shis͟hya Sharaṇāgati” was produced by her and was released on 9th October 2016 on the occasion of the Shāradīya Navarātri Utsava.
