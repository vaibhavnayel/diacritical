### Sānukampā – Divine lessons in Compassion

> **Reported by Shāntalā Sandeep Trāsikar (Teacher at Bāndrā-Khār Prārthanā Varga)**

“Lord Kṛs͟hṇa is as limitless as the sky itself. In this vast creation of His, His divinity is ever present in all- from the smallest germ to the greatest creature- like the thread that runs through the flowers in a garland.” (H.H. Shrīmat Parijñānāshram Swāmījī III at Shrī Ānandāshram, Khār Mat͟h, 04.07.1977)

‘Saanukampaa’ was the title for the Online Prārthanā Varga Shibir which premiered on 19th June 2022 on our very own Shrī Chitrāpur Mat͟h website. The online Shibir was organized  to celebrate the 75th Janmadivasa of our revered 10th Guru. H.H. Shrīmat Parijñānāshram Swāmījī III. Parijñānāshram Swāmījī’s love and compassion towards all creatures great and small is reflected in Their words, “मुक्या जनावरांची नीट काळजी घ्या, त्यांना चांगल्या भांड्यात जेवण द्या \|” and serve as a guiding beacon in Their lessons in compassion for all of us.

The whole programme was put together by the network of Prārthanā teachers in India as well as abroad and the solid cooperation from parents. After the planning, came the recording and sequencing of the videos diligently edited by Aniruddha mām and Smitā Baljekar pāchī. Within a month the whole programme was ready to be broadcast on the Mat͟h website. The programme started with the Sabhā Prārambha prārthanā by the Sāntācruz, Mumbaī Prārthanā Varga.This was followed with the Dīpa Prajwālana by Shirālī Prārthanā Varga. Next came the recitation of Shrī Parijñānāshram Trayodashī by the BeṅgaῙūrū Prārthanā Varga. Meenāks͟hi Baljekar conducted an endearing and rejuvenating yoga session using animal poses for our eager young audience.

Cats, dogs, frogs, turtles all came visiting the living rooms as our children tried out the yogāsana-s patiently demonstrated by Meenāks͟hi pāchī. This was followed by the Karuṇā Club videos sent by various Prārthanā Varga-s. Children spoke about what Compassion meant to them, the benefits of practising it for all of us and the importance of being compassionate towards animals and all creatures around us. Pet videos sent by the children from all the different centres were shown, our children spending time with little calves, fishes, cats, birds, squirrels, parrots, some in homes, some in their natural surroundings but all loved equally and dearly!

It was soon time for the little fingers to get busy! Umā Savūr pāchī demonstrated how to create a lovely paper turtle in swift and simple steps.

A turn and a fold

Circles of paper, the little fingers hold

Skips of Orange and green

Googly eyes looking very keen

A little twist and some glue

A delightful turtle for me and you!

This captivating activity was followed by the much-awaited Janmadivasa song and cake cutting video sent by Cupertino, USA Prārthanā Varga and BeṅgaῙūrū Prārthanā Varga. The Sabhā Samāpti prārthanā was recited by BeṅgaῙūrū Prārthanā Varga.

The programme concluded with chanting of the Dīpanamaskāra, the reverberating sounds of devotion offered at the lotus feet of our cherished Divine Guruparamparā.
