### Discover The Light Within!

> A touching account by KAVITA KARNAD on how taking the first step towards offering _seva_ slowly enables you to shed unwanted clutter and Discover The Light Within!              (October 2017)

Jai Shankar!

Everyone is familiar with the phrase “Calm seas never make good sailors”. Similarly, my journey and quest to connect deeper with the Divine began with profound incidents that were experienced by my family and myself. These evoked a deep sense of reverence, love, gratitude and the desire to offer _seva_ at the Lotus feet of our Guru and our Math.

As a novice devotee, I initially watched in fascination the sincerity and _seva_offered bymore mature

_sadhaka_-s who had been around for a longer time. Soon, however, from just a volunteering parent, I was roped in as a _Prarthana_ teacher. With Parama Pujya Swamiji’s Blessings and encouragement from Smita Nagarkattepachi (who was then a _Prarthana_ teacher herself and is now the Chief-Coordinator) there was no looking back. Interacting with children is a real stress buster and a different experience totally. It hasbeen over 7 years now, and I am soglad to be a part of our _Prarthana Varga_ family. My trips to Karla and Shirali increased and so did my attempt to participate in different activities. Each holistic trip / camp was memorable and wonderful.Making props with other volunteers for stage performances by the little children of Shri Parijnanashram Vidyalaya in Karla was a unique experience altogether.

Parama Pujya Swamiji’s Blessings and Grace never cease to work wonders amongst devotees of all age groups, from senior citizens to the children in _Prarthana_ and the ‘teen-ups’ of _Yuvadhara_. The amazing social outreach projects taken up by our Math under Parama Pujya Swamiji’s Guidance\- like woman- empowerment (through _Samvit Sudha_ and HMPP i.e. Hand made paper products), _Parimochana_ to initiate self-help groups in villages and most importantly, - education (mentoring of educational institutions at Shirali, Mallapur, Mangaluru and Karla) all conjure a feeling of deep pride and joyas the heart reiterates – “This iswhere I belong!”.

From physical fitness with rebounder sessions to emotional wellness and spiritual growth with _japa_, meditation, _pranayam_ and _ninaad_ sessions, His Holinesscontinually ensures thatwe derive maximumbenefit in every sphereof keeping body, mind and spirit in sync.

Papercraft for Prarthana

Parama Pujya Swamiji’s _Aashirvachan_-s, _Upadesha_-s and _Swadhyaya_-s have always been inspiring and motivating in all spheres of my life and also are my constant guiding force. _Satsang_-s with like-minded people havefurther fueled my desire to delve more and deeper into the realm of the Divine _Sannidhya_ of our Beloved Guru. _Seva Saptaha_ gives me the necessarydiscipline, experience and exposure to interact with more devotees. This has taught me to shed my own inhibitions, accept my shortcomings, move past my comfort zone and LEARN!

Observing _mauna_ has changed me a lot. It is an offering I make to the Divine on any one Monday of the month. That day is always special. I increase my _japa_ and immerse myself in HH’s _Swadhyaya_-s and _Ashirvachan_-s..This enables me to introspect, keep control over my emotions and to let go of that unwanted clutter which tends to exhaust so much of our good energy.

The emotional strength that _mauna_stirs within has done wonders in every aspect of my life - in _seva_ or at home, or even in dealing with difficult people and situations. This has made me realize again and again that I take back so much more than what little I attempt to offer as _seva_!

In spite of the differences amongst us, (working style, thinking and attitude) all volunteers have that one strong bond in common, which is the reverence for our Guru and our Math. Where there is vibrancy in singing and chanting, there is also peace and tranquility in meditation and _mauna_. Each _sadhaka_ gets an unfolding platform to display his or her potential amidst the spectrum of varied skills and talent and different professionals. The resulting inspiration and creative output at each gathering at Pujya Swamiji’s camps infuses so much joy andenthusiasm andbecomes a beautiful expression of collective love and gratitude.

HMPP gave Sushma Koppikarpachi and me an opportunity to launch coloring books for children and diaries. Back in my own Santacruz _sabha_, we manage a _Samvit Sudha_ hub with six volunteers (Smita Nagarkatte, Sujata Nadkarni, Shobha Nayampalli, Aditi Mudbidri, Surekha Padbidri and yours truly!).Getting involved in any of these voluntary activitivities may seem difficult in the beginning when self-doubt becomes a huge impediment to one’s own untapped resources. But soon, when realization dawns that participation is what matters and every devotee is important to facilitate growth and bring about a change in himself/ herselfand the_samaja_ at large, the path opens up and more opportunities pour in. It is often said that “Little drops of water, little drops of sand, make the mighty ocean and the mighty land.”

To be a Chitrapur Saraswat and to have a rich and revered _Guru Parampara_ like ours to exalt in, is a true blessing!! So powerful and palpable is the feeling, that once connected, the _Gurushakti_ draws you like a moth to a flame, not to burn, but to discover the light within!!
