### **Report on Shankar Jayanti** **and Shibir** **in Shirali**

Shankar Jayanti fell on 9th May this year and being the first Jayanti after the consecration of the four new shrines at Shri Chitrapur Math, Shirali, it assumed a special significance. A shibir aimed at the Sadhakas in age group of 40-60 years was organized to time with this occasion in the divine presence of Param Poojya Swamiji. Despite the peak summer heat, many devotees thronged with enthusiasm and devotion in large numbers from different cities.

The participants were given a special treat by Swamiji every day. He conducted a ‘swadhyay’ on ‘Updesha Panchakam’ – aptly chosen as a tribute to Adi Shankaracharya. This particular text has a special significance since these were Acharya’s last golden words to His Shishyas nay mankind. Swamiji in His simple but inspiring words elucidated the intricacies of the shlokas.

Then, there was another session with our Madiman Malinipacchi who gave sessions on Bhashya dealing with Upanishad, Bhagawad Geeta and Brahma-sutra. Malinipacchi created interest among the shibirathis for the subject in spite of its difficulty in her own characteristic style. There was a vimarsha session beautifully handled by Savnal Archanapacchi. The topic ‘Moun’ i.e. ‘Silence’ and its different aspects were churned brilliantly by all the participants. Another vimarsh based on Upadesha Panchakam also took place. The enthusiasm of people didn’t stop there. The group of Sadhakas assembled at the end of the day to do ‘manthan’ on the swadhyay much to Swamiji’s delight. All the shibirarthis will be eternally grateful to their beloved Guru for sparing His time with them despite His busy schedule and many ‘Upnayanam’ sanskaars going on in Math at that time. The participants will treasure this memory for years to come.

Our efficient sanchalikas Vinati Udiyavar and Smita Nagarkatti, ably assisted by the volunteers from different sabhas, took great efforts to make the shibir a great success.

The evening of 9th May was a special occasion as it was the first Shankar Jayanti celebrated after the vigraha of Jagat Guru was consecrated in our Math on 15th of Feb. 2008 at the Divine Hands of our Param Poojya Gurudev. The mood for the pooja was rightly created by the beautiful bhajans and stotras rendered by Balsavar Meerapacchi, Vijayalaxmi and Anand Nayampalli , Seetham Basrur, Vinati Udiyavar, Divya Bijur and others. The whole-hearted participation in the pooja by the devotees is an assurance of how the samaj is following the divine path set by our Param Poojya Gurudev. Dharma Sabha followed shortly after and once again devotees were blessed to hear Swamiji’s divine words. He described briefly the universal aspect of the Jagatguru, His prowesss in all Vedas and Shastras. Swamiji also elucidated on how the Adi Shankaracharya re-kindled the Bhakti while remaining focused on the pursuit of Atma jnana. He was a Guru to every soul bringing about its spiritual growth. The Sabha ended with an expression of gratitude and kshamayachana. The devotees who had gathered in large numbers oblivious to the sweltering heat returned to their homes with a promise to themselves to return yet again for this occasion in the years ahead.
