Vocal – Classical

![](https://chitrapurmath.net/documents/upload/1634107697Cover_1._Baddukuli_Venkatesh_Ramakrishna_Bhat.jpg)Passionately fond of classical music, his first Guru was Honnāvar Kṛs̲h̲ṇa Bhaṭ. HH Shrīmat Ānandāshram Swāmījī recognised his talent and sent him to the Marris College at Lucknow for formal training in music under Aṇṇāsāheb Ratañjaṅkar.

He successfully completed his Saṅgeet Vis̲h̲ārad and returned to Shirālī as per the wishes of Swāmījī. Apart from singing melodious bhajana-s in various classical rāga-s, he taught all the young students, Vidyārthī -s and Vaidika-s, in addition to fulfilling his duties as a Vaidika at the Shrī Chitrāpur Mat̲h̲.

The legacy of Paṇḍit Veṅkaṭesh BaḍḍukuῙi, who held a degree from Lucknow Academy of Music (now known as Bhātkhaṇḍe Saṅgeet Vidyāpeet̲h̲) is continued by his nephew B Rādhākṛs̲h̲ṇa Bhaṭ at Beṅgal̄ūru and daughter-in-law Smt. Shyāmalā, who have been training the children of Shirālī with dedication for at least the last two decades.
