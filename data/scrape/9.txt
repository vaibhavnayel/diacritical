Vocal – Classical

Honnāvar Kṛs̲h̲ṇa Bhaṭ, famous as Dantavakra Bhaṭ, was the son of the Parichāraka of Bhaṇḍikeri Mat̲h̲.

His inborn talent and thirst for music took him to the great Maestro Ustād Kāle Khān of the Paṭiālā Gharānā.

After mastering the intricate Sargama-s and Palṭā-s for which this Gharānā is known, Kṛs̲h̲ṇa Bhaṭ came down to Mumbaī and trained a few students. Late Paṇḍit S. N. Ratañjaṅkar was specially sent to him for his initial training.

H.H. Ānandāshram Swāmījī invited him to Shirālī to teach the young Vaidika-s and Vidyārthī-s there.

He trained most of the singer purohit-s like Shukla Laxmaṇ Bhaṭ and BaḍḍukuῙi Veṅkaṭesh Bhaṭ during the tenure of H.H. Ānandāshram Swāmījī.

The senior Purohit singers Shukla Maṅgesh Bhaṭ and Haridās Rāmchandra Bhaṭ consulted him from time to time. Our master musicians Paṇḍit S. C (Shukla Chandrashekhar) R Bhaṭ, Paṇḍit Narendra Paḍukoṇe and his father Paḍukoṇe Shrīpād are said to have had their initial training from him.
