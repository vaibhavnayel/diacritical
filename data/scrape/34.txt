### Sabha-wise Quarterly Activity Report - October to December 2017

> Chitrapur Yuvadhara Sabha-wise Quarterly Activity report -  Period : October - December 2017

1. **Andheri**


Janmadivas of Parama Pujya Sadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji was celebrated with enthusiasm by the Prarthana varga , Yuvadhara and Laity of Andheri Sabha on Sunday, 29th October, 2017 at Shriram School hall. Sabha Prarambha Prarthana was followed by a Ninaad session conducted by Sushma Gokarn pacchi. Everyone arranged their pujana samagri to the accompaniment of melodious bhajans sung by yuvas and pachis. Guru Paduka Stotram and Shri Parijnyanashram Trayodashi filled the air with a feeling of Divinity.

Gurupujana was performed by seventeen members including children from our Prarthana varga and Yuvadhara followed by Mangalaarti and Deepanamaskar. As members settled with some refreshments , the room was filled with melodious music by Utkarsh Hoskote , all of 14years, fingers moving deftly on his keyboard to play old classics as well as new songs which all enjoyed.

To mark this special occasion, we at Andheri Sabha undertook a novel and much needed initiative to show our love and bhakti to our Parama Pujya Swamiji, to make a difference to society. Donation boxes were kept for

Old Clothes - to be donated to NGO Goonj

Electronic Waste - to be recycled responsibly by Eco Rox

Old Shoes - to be donated to Greensole

The idea behind the drive was to reduce the waste going out to our landfills and benefit people in the process.

Electronic waste is poisonous and flammable and recycling ensures safer air.

Old shoes are reused by Greensole to make chappals for rural school children, thus putting our waste to a better use.

Goonj runs Cloth for Work programs where clothes donated are used as payment for rural projects.The project was handled and led by Yuva Niyati Mavinkurve.

The Andheri Sabha fully supported the initiative and the Sabha members donated very generously to the cause. The donations were given to the respective NGOs within a week of collection.

Andheri Sabha hopes to duplicate this drive during Yugadi and introduce more such drives to make a positive difference to the world around us.

Another initiative continued on the Janma Divas celebrations is composting of Nirmalya from Gurupujana. Since Kanakanjali Utsava, Andheri Prarthana varga and Yuvadhara meet up once every month and perform Gurupujan and have been composting nirmalya since July 2016.

**(3) Bengaluru**

**12th Nov:** Everyone was excited to celebrate the Janmadivas of our beloved P.P Swamiji. At 10:30AM, the yuvas and yuvatis gathered, to begin Devi Japa Anushthan. A few of the yuvatis had got together and prepared a Pineapple Upsidedown Cake and Gulab Jamuns for Naivedya. Devyani Padubidri who joined us from the US via Skype, had prepared Tea-infused Cake. We were all set to celebrate the special day.

After reciting the Sabha Prarambh Prarthana and Parijnan Trayodashi, we observed two minutes of Moun in memory of HH Bade Swamiji. Manju Jamalabad Pacchi then guided us as we did Ninaad. As the group, led by Shivani kallianpur, performed Devi Japa Anushthan, we felt transported to another world. We then concluded with the Sabha Samapti Prarthana.

It was soon time for the Shrama Seva which involved cleaning all the photo frames, fans, bells, divlis etc. in the Anandashram Sabhagraha. Time flies when one works hard and we were all surprised when lunch was announced. We put away the cleaning paraphernalia and queued up for a well-deserved Prasad Bhojan.

While we munched on the scrumptious Prasad Bhojan, we started planning for the upcoming Makalidurga trek. Naren Naimpally Maam then asked us for our feedback and suggestions on the various Yuvadhara activities.

As all of us left for the day, our smiles reflected the satisfaction we felt at having spent a memorable day in Seva!

**Firefighting workshop:**

Bengaluru Yuvadhara held a fire fighting workshop under the expert guidance of Shri Mangesh Chikermane mam. The object was to create awareness among sādhakas and the Yuvā varga regarding the various steps and measures to be taken in an event of a fire or any accident/ emergency in the Math premises.

The workshop began with sabha prarambha prarthana.

Participants : Sachin Kalthod, Akhil Golerkeri, Siddharth Savkur, Sanjana Hervatte, Shreyas Hervatte, Akshay Ullal, Shivani Kallianpur, Maitreyi Bellare, Varun Mallapur.

The workshop was divided into 2 phases

In the first phase of the workshop , Mangeshmaam took us through various types of fires and their causes along with the various techniques and equipment to fight the fires in a form of an interactive slide show. With suitable illustrations and subtle humour,Mangeshmaam made the workshop very entertaining and interesting for the us . The slide show also included a short video clip of a mock fire drill conducted by Google in its Hyderabad campus .

In the second phase of the workshop , a similar mock safety evacuation drill was also conducted in our Math compound. An emergency alarm was rung to alert those present and everyone was swiftly evacuated from the Math hall and made to assemble at the emergency assembly point near the yagnashālā. A headcount of all the sādhakas was conducted. This practice is followed in the event of any major emergency to ensure the mitigation of casualties.

After a quick break for refreshment, Mangeshmaam demonstrated the application of the various firefighting equipment as was shown in the slide show.

We got a first hand experience of using various types of fire extinguishers and dealing with varioustypes of fires .

The workshop concluded with Yuva volunteers Sanjana Hervatte , Shreyas Hervatte , Sachin Kaltod, demonstrating the right and wrong technique to escape and also evacuate others from a fire or any emergency situation.

The workshop ended with Sabha Samapti Prarthana.

**Makali Durga Trek:**

The Bengaluru Yuvdhara went on a trek to Makalidurga Betta (hill), 60km from Bengaluru, on 24th Dec’17. On the day, all the yuvas and yuvatis assembled at the Math by 6:30 AM. After prayers, the chattering group boarded the bus while a few volunteers loaded the food. A lively game of Dumb Charades served as an icebreaker and a fun beginning to the journey. By the time we stopped for refreshments at a hotel by the wayside, new games had been introduced and we were eager to restart our road trip after the brief halt.

We soon reached our destination and unloaded our food packets which we then distributed amongst ourselves. After a delicious breakfast of idlis and vadas we were all set to conquer the Makalidurga Betta. Just then a train passed on the railway tracks running through the base of the hill, as though signalling an eventful day ahead.

The hill stands at a height of 4430 feet surrounded by a lake that resembles South American continent. After meeting the forest department officials at the base, we were introduced to our guide for the day- Mr. Raju. We started our ascent by 9:15 AM. The trekking trail differs along the way - changing from a gentle rise to a steep climb and from a grassy terrain to a rocky surface- in a matter of minutes. Most of us were fascinated to note that our guide was climbing the rocky surfaces wearing only chappals while despite wearing trekking shoes, we had to climb carefully. Mr. Raju also gave us some insightful information on the different trees we came across.

The reason trekking is called a team event became evident as the first-timers and novice trekkers were helped and cheered on by the more experienced trekkers. The silence of the hills were frequently punctuated by our loud battle cries of "Bolo re vaanaron, Bhakti ki vaani, Hara hara Mahadev!"

We reached the summit by noon. The peak has the Makalidurga Fort and a Shiva temple. The mind blowing view and the intense silence made us forget all our tiredness. We found an idyllic spot in the shade of a tree to rest. We then started playing a much awaited game of strategy and survival, which took up a solid hour of putting our grey matter to good use. We only realized the time when Naren Naimpally Maam reminded us to have lunch and our stomachs growled in response!

The appetizing meal of Pulao and freshly-made Raita energized us for the descent. By the end of our meal we had some unexpected company in the form of monkeys! (They must have heard our battle cries earlier.) Luckily we had some leftover idlis and vadas which our vaanar-friends were happy to devour.

While climbing up, we had noticed an ideal place where we could perform the Ashtamurthy Upasana. The sheer rock surface looked over the serene lake and far off hills. We settled down and were soon lost in the magic of P.P Swamiji’s voice as we meditated upon the eight elements. The Upasana having revitalised us, we continued our descent. We made it back to the base by 5:15 PM. We quenched our thirst with some cool tender coconut water.

On the bus ride back, we started yet another interesting game, with a small interruption of a halt for refreshments. We got so involved in the game that we were surprised when the bus finally came to a stop outside the Math.

Our memorable trek finally came to an end with prayers, feelings of exhaustion mixed with gratitude at having spent a wonderful day amidst nature and ideas for our next trek!

Keeping up with the Delhi Aamchi Yuvas!

New Friends are like new adventures! On a balmy winter morning of the 17th of December the young Aamchi Yuvas of the Delhi Sabha decided to meet and spend some quality time! It had been quite some time since we last met hence all of us were looking forward to this day.

We decided to meet at Delhi’s famous Hauz Khas Village so the group could experience walking in the lovely lanes of Hauz Khas, while admiring the beautiful boutiques and colourful merchandise stores located in the area.

Hauz Khas is a perfect place for young groups to meet, since the place is a beautiful combination of an old fort area, beautiful gardens with simple & cosy restaurants that offer several dining options and a variety of cuisines.

Our day started with a delightful South Indian breakfast at a famous restaurant chain called “Naivedyam”. Followed by a walk through the narrow lanes which led us to an old fort called the “Hauz Khas Fort.” The fort remains to be one of the most elegant structures in the architectural history of Delhi. The complex nestles amidst beautiful landscapes, enclosed by lush green lawns and a beautiful lake. Also the place happens to be an all-time favourite hangout spot amongst youngsters. We spent some quality time exploring several areas of the fort while some of our Yuva friends who had visited the fort before, shared some significant details on the historical importance of the monument.

Later we visited the Deer Park located inside the village which remains a famous tourist attraction. The Park is one of the oldest structures in Delhi and serves as a favoured picnic spot for the locals. For every bird watcher, the park is an absolute delight!

A little later we stopped by a famous restaurants inside the Hauz Khas for lunch. By midday Hauz Khas is usually filled with youngsters who visit the area to experience the lovely food that the area has to offer!

As we sat down for a lovely meal, each one of us reconnected and talked about our daily routines at work while excitedly discussing our plans for the long weekend ahead. We had a wonderful time with our youngest Yuva – Toshani Nath who kept us all entertained throughout the day.

Every time the Aamchi Yuva group meets up, it’s a beautiful reminder of how we continue to remain a part of such a close knit community like ours. And as we continue to reconnect, when a group like ours meets there is a lot of fun, laughter, light jokes and so much more adding to our memories for life!

We Love to meet and Smile!!!! Cheers To us!
