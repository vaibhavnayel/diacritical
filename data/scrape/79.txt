> About 100 bright and enthusiastic Yuvas of the Parijnan PU College, Someshwar-Kotekar did _kara-seva_ to contribute their mite to the _Swachh Gram –Swachh Bharat_ Mission. Here is a report –                      (February 2018)

The **_Swachh Bharat Abhiyan_** or **Clean India Mission** is a nationwide campaign that aims to clean up the streets, roads and infrastructure of India’s cities, smaller towns, and rural areas. It is a massive movement that seeks to create a Clean India.

In accordance with this, the Sri Ramakrishna Mission, Mangaluru launched a _Swachch_ _Mangaluru_, _Swachh_ _Gram_ and _Swachh_ _Manas_ programme and approached many educational institutions to carry out their Mission.

The management, staff and students of the Parijnan PU College of Science and Commerce based at Someshwar-Kotekar and managed by Saraswat Education Society, pledged gladly to be associated with this national activity. About 100 students (both boys and girls) committed themselves to this noble task of spreading the message of _swachhata_ for 10 consecutive Sundays commencing from 9thOctober, 2017.

Swami Ekagamyanandji of Sri Ramakrishna Mission inaugurated the program at 7.00 am on 9thOctober in the Parijnan PU College of Science and Commerce Campus by flagging off the event. From then on, approximately 70-80 children used to be present in the campus every Sunday to take the message forward by cleaning andremoving weeds on the roads in and around the campus. They undertook cleaning of the Ullal Railway Station too and also thesurrounding areas of Kotekar Panchyat and Someshwar Panchayat, Kotekar Junction Bus Stand, as well as the area outside JS Hospital.

Every Sunday we had the flagging- off ceremony attended by various dignitaries - M/s Chandrashekar,Secretary of Anandashram High School Alumni Association, Ravishankar -member, Taluk Panchayat, Kavya-alumnus of Parijnan PU College, Mamatha Vasugopal – member,Someshwar Panchayat, Nithin Norbert - IRTS, Guruswami Lingappa Gatty of Swamy Ayyappa Temple, Harishchandra Adka – member, Someshwar Panchayat, Ajith Kumar Shetty - Alumnus of Anandashram High School and member Someshwar Panchayat, Dr (Ms) Ajanya of JS Hospital and so on.

This enthusiastic work and cleaning activity undertaken by the students was appreciated greatly by the local residents. It was widely reported in the local press as well. Parents too encouraged the children to go regularly and do their bit for their city and country.

On 24th December, 2017 there was a Mega _Swachh_ Programme at the Mangaluru Central Station, Attavarin which about 175 Yuvas and children from Parijnan PU College and Ganapathy English Medium School participated. This was attended by Swami Ekagamyanandji of RK Mission andthe Hon’ble Commissioner of Police, Mangaluru - Mr.T.R. Suresh I.P.S. The Commissioner appreciated the initiative of our children who wereinvolving themselves in this novel venture and wished them a bright future !
