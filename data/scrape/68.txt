Every year our Prarthana children eagerly await this opportunity to together perform Gurupujan once during Chaturmas.

On 6th August, 14 children geared up to make this special offering to our Beloved Guru.

Children set up their Puja stations and arranged the Pooja Samagri with care. At 3.30pm seven children performed the Puja while the rest helped by offering akshata, flower petals etc.

Children who performed the Guru Pujanam were Tanmay Gokarn, Samvita Hattangadi, Nitya Kadle, Disha Sirur, Devanshi Gokarn, Nishita Ujre and Nimisha Ujre. Children who participated were Samiksha Hattangadi, Om Sirur, Tanushree Shirur, Abhiram Kumta, Sameer Karkal, Parijnana Kumta (Parijnana couldn't perform Pujan himself as he had hurt his hand and has a plaster) and little Shivaunsh Shirur. Three teachers assisted them to perform the Pujan - Aparna Pandit, Sunita Hattangadi and Deepa Sirur.

Guru Pujanam went off very well and a feeling of contentment for having performed it to their heart's content reflected on the children's faces.

After the Pujanam, snacks were served to all who attended, which was sponsored by Pune Sabha. An evening indeed well spent for the Prarthana family and a few sadhakas who were present to encourage the children.
