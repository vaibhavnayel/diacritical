4) Report on Konkani Day by Yuva Representative - Kedar Basrur :-

On the 18th of December, Bengaluru Yuvadhara organised ‘Konkani Day’.

Konkani Day depicted the importance of the language in our daily lives and how essential it is to speak in Konkani. This also helped many of the Yuvas in getting a hold of less often used Konkani vocabulary and helped in learning many Konkani words which can be used in our daily conversations.

Bengaluru Yuvadhara also organised a few games that would make this process of learning more interactive and fun. The games that were played were as follows :-·

Amchigele words with the same meaning used in North and South Kanara areas of Karnataka (Badgi & Tenki as we call them)

Dub-double Amchi words in relation to food (such as – 'nurnuri',‘charchari’,‘bashbashi’)

~Dub-double Amchi words - linking parts of anatomy to aches and pains (such as – ‘dhaddhadu’, ‘bhirbhiru’)

~Rapid fire round on relations (such as – ‘phagar maayi', 'bhacchho’, 'putonyo', 'suna')

This activity acted as an ice-breaker and also got all Yuvas to participate as everyone has a different way of using these words in their daily lives. The events were organised and conducted by Smita Baljekar pachi.

Shortly after this, Smita Baljekar pachi and Udaya Mavinkurve pachi conducted a ‘Ninaada’ session which was an amazing experience as there were a few Yuvas who attended the Ninaada session for the very first time. The Ninaad session went on for a brief 30 minutes where the basics were explained and then practiced accordingly.

The Yuvas who participated in the above events in December 2016 were;

Gowri Trasi, Rachana Amladi, Dhruthiman Padubidri, Sachidanand Manikere, Surabhi Karnad, Nischal Kodange, Kedar Basrur, Prakash Tonse , Prasad Tonse

**(v) ANDHERI**

Andheri Sabha's green Gurupujan-s

Since Kanakanjali, the Andheri Sa​bha, Yuvas and Prarthana Varg perform Gurupujan once a month. In continuation of the devotion that they felt during Kanakanjali, it was decided in June 2016 to make the Gurupujans green by responsibly disposing off the Nirmalya. The Nirmalya flowers are taken and composted which ensures they are not thrown in a landfill.

The Yuvas and Prarthana Varg believe in following Parama Pujya Swamiji's footsteps and making a difference to the environment around them.

​Composting of the Nirmalya flowers is done by Niyati Mavinkurve.

Niyati and her family have been composting waste since February 2016. This has saved about 80kgs of waste from ending in the landfill in the past 9 months. Niyati has been working to get people to adopt composting so that they can be closer to nature and can reduce pollution and garbage in Mumbai
