**Bangalore:**

On Sunday, 10th June 2018, 48 children and 10 teachers of all Bengaluru _Prarthana Varga_-s came together at the Shri Chitrapur Math Swami Anandashram Sabhagriha for the annual day-long _Prarthana shivir-_ “ _Ravikiran_” -  organised to commemorate the _Janma Divasa_ of P.P. Shrimat Parijnanashram Swamiji lll.

By 9.30 am Smita Baljekar and Smita Naimpally were at the registration counter greeting everyone as they came in. In fact, the seniormost children were also being trained to do the registration. Children from all the four _Varga_-s of Bengaluru _Prarthana_ bonded with each other on this special day..

At 10am sharp the _Sabha Prarambha Prarthana_ was recited followed by the _Parijnanashram Trayodashi_. Uma Trasi pachi addressed the children and explained it was the _Janma Divasa_ of P.P. Shrimat Parijnanashram Swamiji lll on 15th June. She then showed them the invitation card of the _shivir_ which had a sun on it and told them why the _shivir_ was called “ _Ravikiran_”. A _Sunbeam_ copy with Lord Bhavanishankar on the cover was also shown to the children for identification. _Ravikiran_ is its children’s section with story time, activity and a science file. _Sunbeam_ was first started by PP Shrimad Anandashram Swamiji and it was earlier called ‘ _Ravikiran’_.

“ _Surya namaskara_” was introduced by Manju Jamalabadpachi to the children. Two _Yuvati_-s- Ananya Kallianpur _akku_ and Nishtha Naimpally _akku_ stood on the stage to demonstrate the _asana-s_. They started with warm- ups of stretches and neck and shoulder rotations before commencing with _surya namaskara_. Manju pachi wrote the _12 mantra-_ s of the _surya namaskara_ on the white board and recited the _mantra_-s with each posture. The children repeated the _mantra_-s as they performed the _surya namaskara_ 6 times. In the end they were made to relax by doing the “ _Shavasana_”.

This was followed by a drink of fresh coconut water served to all the children, volunteers and teachers.

_Ravikiran Rangoli_ activity- The children were asked why _rangoli_-s were made …some of the replies received were “To welcome God”; “The house should look colourful as you enter”; “For festivals “; “Amamma taught me how to make _rangoli_”\- said Navya. A big beautiful sun with rays was drawn in chalk by Sudha Ullalpachi and Uma Savurpachi on the stage in front of the photograph of Parama Pujya Parijnanashram Swamiji. The children were divided into two groups and they came on the stage in an organised manner and daintily arranged flower petals into the pattern. Different shades of yellow, orange and red flowers were used to create the bright hue of the magnificent sun. White petals from Uma Savurpachi’s home- grown hibiscus were used for the eyes, _tulsi_ strands were used to make Suryamaam’s moustache, red rose petals were used to create a smiley and the final effect was a dazzling and jubilant _Ravikiran_!!

The children were given print-outs of the “ _Paduka_” for colouring and the meaning of the word “Pa-du-ka” was explained by Uma Trasi pachi. The _paduka_-s were coloured innovatively by the children and they pasted them in their respective Samvit Sudha HMPP scrap books. They were taught to write “ _Shri Gurubhyo Namaha_” on top of the page above the picture of the _Paduka-s_. The books were then placed in front of the photo of Guru Swami on the stage as their offering.

Before lunch was served children recited _shlokas, bhajans_ and teachers sang _Guru sharanam_ and Smita Namipally pachi taught the children to sing “ _Bola Jaijaikara_” explaining that it is sung when Pujya  Swamiji arrives in the Math. _Naivedya_ was offered at the photo of Parama Pujya Parijnanashram Swamiji.

A sumptuous traditional lunch of _aamras_, _puri_, _humman_, _dali toi,_ rice, _dhanvi kheeri_ and _puran poli_  was enjoyed by the children in the _bhojan shala_. The children recited “ _Brahmarpanam” shloka_ before partaking of the _prasad bhojan._

Post-lunch the children were divided into three groups called “ _Bhakti_”, “ _Shraddha_” and “ _Nishtha_” for playing the game “passing the _batwo_”. They were shown a power- point presentation by Smita Baljekarpachi based on the _Anugraha_ stories from our _Guruparampara_. Uma Savurpachi and Gayatripachi took turns to tell the stories according to the slides shown and in between the slides teachers would sing “ _Gurudevon ki amara shakti se”_ while the children would pass the _batwo_. When the temple bell was rung the child with the _batwo_ would have to take out the article and the group would have to answer the question. The article would be connected to the story they had just heard from the _Guruparampara_ .

Beena Savkurpachi made animal sounds on the microphone and the children had to identify the animal and tell its name in both Konkani and Sanskrit. Children loved this game.

Sadhana Kaikinipachi conducted ‘Riddle-Time’ based on the  episodes from our _Guruparampara_. She gave clues to make the children guess important names and words like “Gokarn” the place where our ancestors prayed for a Guru, “ _Bhiksha_” was connected to the Brahmin from Bankikodla and so on. Alongside, Smita Baljekar pachi showed relevant pictures on the projector screen. Sadhana pachi also played a number game where the child had to say _aamras_ when the number was a multiple of 3. The children were very attentive and focussed while playing this game but they had fun too!

A Do- It –Yourself activity came next and the dish was - _KalyaPhovu_! Beenapachi taught all the children how to make this lovely dish which was the  favourite of Parama Pujya Shrimad Anandashram Swamiji and is also offered to Lord Krishna on Gokulashtami.

The finale was - cake cutting.The main cake and cupcakes made by Yuvati Jayati Nayel akku were offered to Pujya Swamiji by placing them on the stage below the photograph. _Shri ParijnanashramTrayodashi_ was recited and group photographs taken. Later the youngest children were made to cut the cake.

The children were also served _prasad_ of  sweet _boondi_, _biscut ambode,_ jack fruit and cup cakes  along with an orange flavoured drink.  _Ravikiran Shivir_ thus concluded on a happy and fulfilling  note at 4.15pm after the recitation of _Sabha Samapti Prarthana._

**Mumbai:**

_VANDE GURUPARAMPARAM_ was selected as the theme for this year’s annual _Prarthana Varga Shiviram_ held at Shri Anandashram Math, Khar on June 3rd to celebrate the _Janma Divasa_ of our Parama Guru Pujya Parijnanashram Swamiji III.

The young _sadhaka_-s gathered at the Khar Math and registered their attendance for the event. After _Sabha Prarambha_ Prayers, Padmini Balsekarpachi gave an introduction to our Divine _Guruparampara_, how it came into being and how it has been guiding us on the spiritual path.

The first activity of the day was a Yoga session by Shweta Manjeshwarpachi. _Asana_-s depicting some of our Hindu  Deities like Lord Krishna in _Sheshabhadrasana,_ Lord Ramain _Veerabhadrasana, Natarajasana_ and Lord _Hanuman Asana_. These _asana_-s will help develop the individual’s strength, make him/her fearless, and able to focus on important aims in life. The children were instructed to focus on Our Pujya Swamiji’s photo to practise concentration to help enhance their ability in paying attention. The yoga session concluded with _Pranam Asana_ or the bowing _asana_ that replicates the posture of offering _pranam_-s to our parents, Gurus and our teachers. After the yoga session it was time to feast on some delicious snacks made by Gangavali caterers.

After that short break, the Santacruz _Prarthana varg_ presented a skit on our _Guruparampara_. The skit took all the attendees on an ‘armchair journey’ through the glory of our Chitrapur Math at Shirali. It was the story of a Brahmin who lived in Bankikodla during the time of Parama Pujya Shankarashram Swamiji I. The story was penned by Mangala Chandavarkarpachi and scripted by Sujata Haldipurpachi. The story preached the importance of devotion to the Lord. After the beautiful play, the children were divided into four groups for a _paleru_.

**Decoration activity**

The decorated _paleru_ is used during our Holy offerings to Lord and / or during _Paduka Pujanam_ or _Gurupujanam._ Beautiful and colourful flowers were distributed and children were asked to decorate the _paleru_ in their own artistic ways. Replicas of _Paduka_-s, made out of cardpaper and silver foil were provided by Smita Nagarkatti Pachi. The decorated _paleru_-s were offered to the deities of the Khar Math along with Vinati Udiyawarpachi’s melodious bhajan “ _Guru Humare”._

Then, Aditi Mudbidripachi and Sangeeta Pawarpachi taught _prasad-_ making _._ Children were taught to make _panchakdaya_\- a _naivedyam_ offered to Lord Ganesha. _Panchakdaya_ is made up of five ingredients - Bengal gram powder, dry coconut, powdered sugar, _khuskhus_ (poppy seeds) and  cardamom powder. The second recipe was _kallyaphow_, a savoury dish enjoyed by Lord Krishna and offered to Him during _Janmashtami_. _Kallyaphow_ is also offered as a _naivedya_ at Parama Pujya Anandashram Swamiji’s _Samadhi_. _Kallyaphow_ is mainly made of _phow_(beaten rice) and curd. Children enjoyed this session. It was now time for the children to have a healthy lunch. The best feature of this _shivir_ was children sitting in a beautifully disciplined manner while having their lunch.

Post- lunch it was quiz time. Shilpa Mudurpachi conducted an amazing quiz session onour _Guruparmpara_, after which the children recited _shloka_-s in a session conducted by Sujata Haldipurpachi and Varada Soukurpachi. Each child was given an opportunity to chant _shloka_-s on the  Guru..Next  came game-time, fun-time. The children enjoyed outdoor games such as “Find your Math” and “find your partner” both planned by Srikala Sthalekarpachi and Kripa Chandavarkarpachi.

The next event was the cake cutting session. The yummy chocolate cake was baked by a Yuvati, Avani Mudbidri along with delicious chocolates made by Yuvati, Anuja Bondal. The cake was cut by children helped by Shilpa Mudurpachi and offered at the Lotus feet of Parama Pujya Parijnanashram Swamiji III. The _diya_-s were lit and _Shri Parijnanashram Trayodashi_ was recited by everyone. The children were given a beautiful frame of our four Gurus as a memento of the _Shivir_.
