### Devabhasha

> Our revered Guru-Parama Pujya Sadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji has been very keen that all members of the Chitrapur Saraswat _samaj_ should learn to converse in Sanskrit. This detailed report by SUJATA HALDIPUR, on behalf of _Girvanapratishtha -_ the Department of Sanskrit Studies, Shri Chitrapur Math, will tell you in how many ways the growing band of devoted teachers is trying to acquaint us with the incomparable sweetness and the innumerable gems in the vast treasury of our                                             January 2019

The love for and erudition in the Devabhasha - Sanskrit is ingrained in our Chitrapur Saraswat samaj since centuries. Our Math’s prayers - Bhavani Shankar Suprabhatam, Shankar Narayan Geetam, Deepa Namaskar composed by our ancestors are a few examples which endorse this fact. A deep desire to share this treasure with all those who wish to be enthralled by it, has given birth to Girvanapratishtha- a department of Sanskrit Studies founded by our Beloved Guru Parama Pujya Sadyojat Shankarashram Swamiji.

In the year 2001, as per Pujya Swamiji’s Adesh that people should learn and converse in Sanskrita (this was an unfulfilled wish of our Parama Guru- Pujya Parijnanashram Swamiji III), carefully compiled web lessons were uploaded on the internet. The lessons are very easy to follow and have an avid following both in India and abroad.

Around 2003, regular classes began. A proper syllabus was formulated. Girvanapratishtha has well- designed courses which gradually enable a student not only to decipher the meaning of the shloka-s, stotra-s recited by him/her, but also instill the confidence to converse in Sanskrit. The Sanskrit lessons have been divided into four courses. Till date, approximately 2,500 students have successfully completed the courses (Upasana, Aradhana, Sadhana and Dharana).

Girvanapratishtha is trying to promote Sanskrit - a holy Gurukarya- in the following manner. Here is a succint summary of the variety of activities conducted over 2017 and 2018 to inspire love for this Divine language –

Every Tuesday _sambhashana_ classes are conducted by Sadhana Kaikini pachi at Jayanagar.

Every Wednesday- Sunetra Nagarkatte pachi conducts _sambhashana_ classes for her students at her residence at Vijayanagar. About six students attend this _sambhashana_ _varga_. A _Ninaada_ session is conducted by Sunetrapachi after the class.

On alternate Fridays, the teachers in Bengaluru share  best teaching practices amongst themselves to discover different teaching methodologies for various topics.

5 _Sambhashana shivirs_ were held in Bengaluru. Often, a _shivir_ is conducted during Swamiji’s visit to a _sabha_.

6. So far, almost 60-65 teachers have taught in various Sanskrit classes. Many times, as the students complete the curriculum, they join the teachers’ group. Sometimes, Pujya Swamiji encourages the students to teach so that  their own concepts become clear.

7\. _Girvanavaikhari_ \- An online interactive class for students abroad (USA) has been started by Shilpa Mudurpachi with great success.

8\. Sanskrit sessions comprising games, music and fun were conducted by Shilpa Mudur pachi during the _Kara Seva shiviram,_ wherein there was enthusiastic participation by youths under the global umbrella called _Yuvadhara!_

9\. During _Chaturmas_ regular _Sambhashana varga_ was conducted by the teachers who were present at the venue.

10\. An audio recording of the Sanskrit book _‘Prerana’_ in the voice of our beloved late Seetham Basrur pachi was uploaded on our website - as a befitting tribute to her _seva._

All this joyful learning and sharing is offered at the Lotus Feet of our Beloved Guru who is constantly encouraging us.
